<h2>FIRST AID TO TOMMY ATKINS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
Sir,&mdash;I visited the Military Exhibition the other day according
to your instructions, my bosom glowing with patriotic ardour. If
anything besides your instructions and the general appropriateness
of the occasion had been necessary to make my bosom glow thus, it
would have been found in the fact that
I formerly served my country in a
Yeomanry Regiment. I shall never forget
the glorious occasions on which I
wore a cavalry uniform, and induced
some of my best friends to believe I had
gone to the dogs and enlisted. However,
to relate my Yeomanry adventures,
which included a charge by six of us
upon a whole army, would be to stray
from my point, which is to describe
what I saw at the Military Exhibition.
I was lame (oh, dear no, not the gout,
a mere strain) and took a friend, an
amiable young man, with me to lean upon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/061-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/061-1.png" alt="Yeoman with Umbrella" /></a></div>

<p>"There's one place I really <i>do</i> know,"
he had said to me, "and that's this
bally place."</p>

<p>I therefore felt I was safe with him.
We arrived. We entered. "Take me," I said, "to the battle-pictures,
so that I may study my country's glories."</p>

<p>"Right!" he answered, and with a promptitude that does him
immense credit, he brought me out into a huge arena in the open
air with seats all round it, a grand stand, and crowds of spectators.
The performance in the arena so deeply interested me that I forgot
all about the pictures. I saw at once what it was. Detachments
of our citizen soldiers were going through ambulance drill. The
sight was one which appealed to our common humanity. My daring,
dangerous Yeomanry days rose up again before me, and I felt that
if ever I had had to bleed for my QUEEN I should not have bled
untended. Even my companion, a scoffer, who had never risen
above a full privacy in the Eton Volunteers, was strangely moved.
There were, I think, ten detachments, each provided with a stretcher
and a bag containing simple surgical appliances. All that was
wanted to complete the realism of the picture was the boom of the
cannon, the bursting of shells, and the rattle of musketry. In
imagination I supplied them, as I propose to do, for your benefit,
Sir, in the following short account.</p>

<p>It was a sultry afternoon; the battle had been raging for hours;
the casualties had been terrible. "Dress up, there, dress up!" said
the Sergeant in command, addressing detachment No. 2, "and you,
JENKINS, tilt your forage-cap a leetle more over your right ear;
BROWN, don't blow your nose, the General's looking; God bless my
soul, THOMPSON, you've buckled that strap wrong, undo it and
re-buckle it at once." With such words as these he cheered his
men, while to right and left the death-dealing missiles sped, on
their course. "Stand at ease; 'shon! Stand at ease! 'shon!" he
next shouted. A Corporal at this point was cut in two by a ball
from, a forty-pounder, but nobody paid any heed to him. Stiff,
solid, and in perfect line, stood the detachments waiting for the
word to succour the afflicted. At last it came. In the midst of
breathless excitement the ten bent low, placed their folded stretchers
on the ground, unbuckled and unfolded them, and then with a
simultaneous spring rose up again and resumed their impassive
attitude. "Very good," said the Sergeant, "very good. THOMPSON
you were just a shade too quick; you must be more careful. Stand
at ease!" and at ease they all stood.</p>

<p>But where were the wounded? Aha! here they come, noble, fearless
heroes, all in line, marching with a springy step to their doom.</p>

<p>One by one they took their places, in line at intervals of about
ten yards, and lay down each on his appointed spot to die, or be
wounded, and to be bandaged and carried off. But now a terrible
question arose. <i>Would there be enough to go round?</i> I had only
counted nine of them, which was one short of the necessary complement,
but at this supreme moment another grievously wounded
warrior ran lightly up and lay down opposite the tenth detachment.
We breathed again.</p>

<p>And now began some charming manoeuvres. Each detachment
walked round its stretcher twice, then stood at ease again, then at
attention, then dressed up and arranged itself, and brushed, itself
down. All this while their wounded comrades lay writhing, and
appealing for help in vain. It was with difficulty that, lame as I
was, I could be restrained from dashing to their aid. But at last
everything was in order. Stretchers were solemnly lifted. The
detachments marched slowly forward, and deposited their stretchers
each beside a wounded man. Then began a scene of busy bandaging.
But not until the whole ten had been bound up, legs, arms, heads,
feet, fingers &amp;c, was it permissible to lift one of them from the
cold cold ground which he had bedewed with his blood.</p>

<p>"Now then," said the Sergeant, "carefully and all together.
Lift!" and all together they were lifted and placed in their stretchers.
More play with straps and buckles, more rising and stooping, and
then the pale and gasping burdens were at last raised and carried in
a mournful procession round the ground. But when they arrived at
the place where the ambulance was supposed to be, they had all
been dead, three-quarters of an hour. "Dear me," said the Sergeant,
"how vexing. ROBINSON, your chin-strap's gone wrong. Now, all
together. Drop 'em!" And so the day ended, and the pitiless sun
sated with, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I afterwards visited the Field Hospital to see a number of wax
figures in uniform, cheerfully arranged as wounded men in all the
stages of pain and misery. How encouraging for TOMMY ATKINS,
I thought to myself; but at this moment my supporter informed
me that he had remembered where to find the battle-pictures, and
thither therefore we proceeded, thankful in the knowledge that if
either of us ever happened to be struck down in battle he would be
well looked after by an admirably drilled body of men.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,<br />
Yours as usual,</p>

<h2>THE PROFESSIONAL GUEST
AT A COUNTRY HOUSE.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

<p>Trusting that you take some interest in my fate, after the
more or less pleasant (?) week I spent at Henley, I hasten to let you
know that I am again visiting friends, though this time on <i>terra
firma</i>, and that the customary trials of the "Professional Guest"
are once more my portion. The very evening of my arrival, I discovered
that a man with whom I had not been on speaking terms for
years was to be my neighbour at dinner, and that a girl (who really
I cannot understand <i>any one</i> asking to their house) with the
strangest coloured hair, and the most unnaturally dark eyes, was
taken in by the host, and called "darling" by the hostess. After
dinner, which, by reason of the "range" being out of order, was of
a rather limited type, they all played cards. That is a form of
amusement I don't like&mdash;I can't afford it; and this, coupled with
the fact that I was not asked to sing, somewhat damped my ardour
as regards visiting strange houses.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/061-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/061-2.png" alt="The Odd Girl Out" /></a></div>

<p>A hard bed, and a distant snore, kept me awake till break of day,
when, for a brief space, I successfully wooed Morpheus. I think I
slept for seven minutes. Then a loud bell rang, and several doors
on an upper floor were heavily banged. I
heard the servants chattering as they went
down to breakfast. Then there was silence,
and once more I composed myself to rest, when
the dreadest sound of all broke on my ear.
<i>The baby began to cry.</i> Then I gave it up as
hopeless, but it was with a sensation of being
more dead than alive that I crawled down to
breakfast&mdash;late, of course. One is always late
the first morning in a strange house&mdash;one can
never find one's things. I bore with my best
professional smile the hearty chaff of my host
(how I hate a hearty man the first thing in
the morning) and the audible remarks of the
dear children who were seated at intervals round the table. But
my patience well-nigh gave way when I found that our hostess had
carefully mapped out for her guests a list of amusements (save the
mark!) which extended not only over that same day, but several
ensuing ones.</p>

<p>I am not of a malice-bearing nature, but I do devoutly pray that
she, too, may one day taste the full horror of being tucked into a
high dog-cart alongside of a man who you know cannot drive; the
tortures, both mental and physical, of a long walk down dusty roads
and over clayey fields to see that old Elizabethan house "only a mile
off;" or the loathing induced by a pic-nic among mouldering and
utterly uninteresting ruins. All this I swallowed with the equanimity
and patience born of many seasons of country-house visiting;
I even interviewed the old family and old-fashioned cook, on the
subject of a few new dishes, and I helped to entertain some of those
strange aboriginal creatures called "the county." But the announcement
one afternoon, that we were to spend the next in driving ten
miles to attend a Primrose League <i>Fête</i> in the private grounds of a
local magnate, proved too much for me. Shall you be surprised to
hear that on the following morning I received an urgent telegram recalling
me to town? My hostess was, or affected to be, overwhelmned
that by my sudden departure I should miss the <i>fête</i>. I knew, however,
that the "dyed" girl rejoiced, and in company with the
objectionable man metaphorically threw up her hat.</p>

<p>As I passed through the Lodge-gates on my way to the station I
almost vowed that I would never pay another visit again. But even
as I write, an invitation was brought me. It is from my Aunt. She
writes that she has taken charming rooms at Flatsands, and hopes I
will go and stay with her there for a few days. She thinks the sea air
will do me good. Perhaps it will. I shall write at once and accept.</p>

<h2>FROM OUR YOTTING YORICK, P.A.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Aboard the Yot "Placid," bound for Copenhagen (I hope).</i></p>

<blockquote><p>
DEAR EDITOR,</p>

<p>You told me when I set sail (I didn't set sail myself, you
understand, but the men did it for me, or rather for my friends,
Mr and Mrs. SKIPPER, to whose kindness I owe my present position&mdash;which
is far from a secure one,&mdash;but no matter), you said to me,
YORICK Yotting has no buffoonery left in him? I too, who was
once the life of all the Lifes and Souls of a party! Where is that
party now? Where am <i>I</i>? What is my life on board? Life!&mdash;say
existence. I rise early; I can't help it. I am tubbed on deck:
deck'd out in my best towels. So I commence the day by going to
Bath. [That's humorous, isn't it? I hope so. I mean it as such.]</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/062-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/062-1.png" alt="Mr. Punch and Toby in a Cariole" /></a></div>

<p>"Send me notes of your voyage to Sweden and Norway, and the
land of <i>Hamlet</i>. You'll see lots of funny things, and you'll take
a humorous view of what isn't funny; send me your humorous
views." Well, Sir, I sent you "<i>Mr. Punch looking at the Midnight
Sun</i>." pretty humorous I think ("more pretty than humorous," you
cabled to me at Bergen), and since that I have sent you several
beautiful works of Art, in return for which I received another
telegram from you saying, "No 'go.' Send something funny."
The last I sent ("<i>The Church-going Bell</i>," a pretty peasant woman
in a boat&mdash;"<i>belle</i>," you see) struck me as very humorous. The idea
of people going to Church in a boat!</p>

<p>What was I to do?
Well&mdash;here at last I
send you something
which <i>must</i> be
humorous. It looks
like it. <i>Mr. Punch</i>
driving in Norway,
in a <i>cariole. Mr.
Punch</i> anywhere is
humorous; and with
TOBY too; though I
am perfectly aware
that TOBY, M.P., is
in his place in the
House; but then
TOBY is ubarquitous.
That's funny, isn't
it?&mdash;see "bark" substituted
for "biq," the original word being "ubiquitous." This is
the sort of "<i>vürdtwistren</i>" at which they roar in Sweden.</p>

<p>It's all <i>très bien</i> (very well) but how the deuce can you be funny
in the Baltic? Why call it Baltic? For days and nights at sea,
sometimes up, more often down, and a sense of inability coming
over me in the middle of the boundless deep. Alas, poor YORICK!</p>

<p>Then breakfast. Then lunch. Then dinner. No drinking permitted
between meals: to which regulation. <i>I am gradually becoming
habituated.</i> It is difficult to acquire new habits. Precious difficult
in mid-ocean, where there isn't a tailor. [Humorous again, eh?]
I now understand what is the meaning of "a Depression is crossing
the Atlantic." There's an awful Depression hanging about the
Baltic.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:70%;"><a href="images/062-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/062-2.png" alt="Sketch of Elsinore" /></a></div>

<p>I send you a sketch of Elsinore, as I thought it would be, and
Elsinore as it is. Elsinore is like the Pumping Works at Barking
Creek. And I've come all this way to see this!! Elsinore! I'd
rather go Elsewhere-inore,&mdash;say, Margate.</p>

<p>Think I shall put
this in a bottle, cork
it up, and send it
overboard, and you'll
get it by Tidal Post.
Whether I do this or
not depends on circumstances
over which
I may possibly have
no control. Anyhow,
at dinner-time, <i>I shall
ask for the bottle.</i>
When you ask for it,
see that you get it.</p>

<h3>DOING IT CHEAPLY.</h3>

<p>A re-action against the extravagance
which marked the entertainments of the
London Season of 1890 having set in, the following
rules and regulations will be observed
in the Metropolis until further notice.</p>

<p>1. Persons invited to dinner parties will be
expected to furnish their own plate and linen,
and some of the viands and wines to be used
at the feast.</p>

<p>2. To carry out the above, a <i>menu</i> of the
proposed meal will form a part of every card
of invitation, which will run as follows:&mdash;"Mr.
and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; request the honour of
Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s company to dinner, on
&mdash;&mdash; when they will kindly bring with them
enough for twelve persons of the dish marked
&mdash;&mdash; on the accompanying <i>Menu</i>, P.T.O."</p>

<p>3. Persons invited to a Ball will treat the
supper as a pic-nic, to which all the guests
are expected to contribute.</p>

<p>4. On taking leave of a hostess every guest
will slip into her hand a packet containing a
sum of money sufficient to defray his or her
share of the evening's expenses.</p>

<p>5. Ladies making calls at or about five
o'clock, will bring with them tea, sugar, milk,
pound-cake, cucumber sandwiches, and bread
and butter.</p>

<p>6. As no bands will be furnished at evening
parties, guests who can play will be expected
to bring their musical instruments
with them. N.B. This does not apply to
pianofortes on the premises, for which a small
sum will be charged to those who use them.</p>

<p>7. Should a <i>cotillon</i> be danced, guests will
provide their own presents, which will become
the perquisites of the host and hostess.</p>

<p>8, <i>and lastly</i>. Should the above rules, compiled

<p>HOME-ING.&mdash;Dr. BARNARDO'S delightfully
simple plan of getting a little boy to sign an
affidavit to the effect that he was so happy at
Dr. BARNARDO'S Home, Sweet Home, and that,
wherever he might wander, there was really
no place on earth like Dr. BARNARDO'S Home,
may remind Dickensian students of a somewhat
analogous method apparently adopted
by <i>Mr. Squeers</i> when, on his welcome return
to Dotheboys Hall, he publicly announced
that "he had seen the parents of some boys,
and they're so glad to hear how their sons
are getting on, that there's no prospect at all
of their going away, which, of course, is a very
pleasant thing to reflect upon for all parties."
The conduct of such parents or relatives
who send children or permit them to be sent
to Dr. BARNARDO'S Home, Sweet Home, where,
at all events, they are well fed and cared for,
bears some resemblance to that of <i>Graymarsh's</i>
maternal aunt, who was "short of money,
but sends a tract instead, and hopes that
<i>Graymarsh</i> will put his trust in Providence,"
and also to that of <i>Mobb's</i> "mother-in-law,"
who was so disgusted with her stepson's conduct
(for DICKENS meant step-mother when he
wrote "mother-in-law"&mdash;an odd <i>lapsus
calami</i> never subsequently corrected) that she
"stopped his halfpenny a-week pocket-money,
and had given a double-bladed knife
with a corkscrew in it to the Missionaries,
which she had bought on purpose for him."
We don't blame Dr. BARNARDO&mdash;much; but
we do blame these weak-knee'd parents and
guardians, who apparently don't know their
own minds. In the recent case which was
sarcastically treated by the Judge, Dr. B.
found that he could buy GOULD too dear.</p>

<h2>SOMETHING LIKE A REVOLUTION!</h2>

<p class="center"><i>(From Our Own Correspondent on the Spot.)</i></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/064-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/064-1.png" alt="Our Correspondent at Breakfast" /></a>Our Correspondent at Breakfast.</div>

<p><i>Samol Plazo</i>, 8 A.M.&mdash;My <i>plat</i> of <i>egsibaconi</i> has just been knocked
out of the hands of my servant, PATPOTATO, by a bullet. My man
(who is of Irish extraction) thinks that the long-expected revolution
must have commenced; "for," as he argues, "when everything
is down, something is sure to be up." I think so too. I am now
going to Government House. If I don't get this through, make
complaint at the Post Office, for it will be their fault not mine.</p>

<p>9 A.M.&mdash;Am now at Head Quarters. Not much trouble getting here.
Came by a <i>bussi</i>, a local conveyance drawn by two horses, and much
used by the humbler classes. On our road one of the steeds and the
roof of the <i>bussi</i> were carried away by a shell, but as I was inside
this caused me little annoyance, and I got comfortably to my
destination with the remainder. Just seen the President, who says
laughingly, that
"there has been
practically nothing
but perfect
peace and quiet."
I doubt whether
this can be quite
the case, as he was
sitting in front of
Government
House, which was
at that very moment
undergoing
a vigorous bombardment.
When
I pointed this out
to him, he confessed
that he had
noticed it himself,
but did not think
much of it. He
was in excellent spirits, and told me a funny story about the narrow
escape of his mother-in-law. I am now off to see how the other side
are progressing. If the Post Office people tell you they can't send
my telegrams to you, refuse to believe them.</p>

<p>10 A.M.&mdash;As I suspected, from the first, there <i>has</i> been a disturbance.
I thought it must be so, as I could not otherwise understand why my
<i>cabbi</i> should have been blown into the air, while passing through a
mined street on the road here. I am now at the Head Quarters of
the Oniononi, who seem to be in great strength. They appear to be
very pleased that the fleet should have joined them, and account for
the action by saying that the sailors, as bad shots, would naturally
blaze away at the biggest target&mdash;Government House. So far, the
disturbances have caused little inconvenience. I date this 10 A.M.,
but I cannot tell you the exact time, as the clock-tower has just been
carried away by a new kind of land torpedo.</p>

<p>12, NOON.&mdash;I am now once again at the Government Head Quarters.
As I could get no better conveyance, I inflated my canvas carpet-bag
with gas, and used it as a balloon. I found it most valuable in crossing
the battery which now masks the remains of what was once Government
House. The President, after having organised a band of <i>pic-pockettini</i>
(desperadoes taken from the gaols), has gone into the provinces,
declaring that he has a toothache. By some, this declaration
is deemed a subterfuge, by others, a statement savouring of levity.
The artillery are now reducing the entire town to atoms, under the
personal supervision of the Minister of Finance, who deprecates
waste in ammunition, and
declares that he is bound to
the President by the tie of
the battle-field.</p>

<p>2 P.M.&mdash;Have rejoined the
Oniononi, coming hither by
ricochet on a spent shell.
The people are entirely with
them, and cheer at every
fresh evidence of destruction.
Found a well-known
shopkeeper in ecstasies over
the ruins of his establishment.
He said that, "Although
the revolution might
be bad for trade, it would
do good, as things wanted
waking up." A slaughter of
police and railway officials,
which has just been carried
out with infinite spirit,
seems to be immensely
popular. If you don't get
this, make immediate complaint. Don't accept, as an excuse, that
the wires have been cut, and the office razed to the ground. They
can get it through, if they like.</p>

<p>4 P.M.&mdash;Just heard a report that I myself have been killed and
buried. As I can get no corroboration of this statement, I publish
it under reservation. I confine myself to saying that it may be true,
although I have my doubts upon the subject.</p>

<p>6 P.M.&mdash;It seems (as I imagined) that the report of my death and
funeral is a canard. This shows how necessary it is to test the
truth of every item of information before hurrying off to the Telegraph
Office. Efforts are now being made to bring about a reconciliation
between the contending parties.</p>

<p>8 P.M.&mdash;The revolution is over. When both sides had exhausted
their ammunition, peace naturally became a necessity. The contending
parties are now dining together, <i>al fresco</i>, as the town is
in ruins. Nothing more to add save, All's well that ends well!</p>

<h3>MR. PUNCH'S DICTIONARY OF PHRASES.</h3>

<h4>WORKMEN'S.</h4>

<p><i>"Merry Christmas to you, Sir, and many on 'em!" i.e.,</i> "Have
you got that half-crown handy?"</p>

<h4>IN THE SMOKING-ROOM.</h4>

<p><i>"Quite so; but then, you see, that's not my point;" i.e.,</i> "It <i>was</i>,

<p>"BRAVO, TORO!"&mdash;M. CONSTANS will not allow Bull-fighting in
Paris, even for "the benefit of the Martinique sufferers." Quite
right! But if he would only discourage "Bull-fighting" in Egypt&mdash;the

would do good service to the land of the Pyramids, to the poor

<p>NOTE FROM BRIGHTON.&mdash;The exterior of the recently-opened Hôtel

is likely to receive many commissions for the erection of similar
hostelries at our principal marine resorts. He will take out letters
patent for change of name, and be known henceforward as Mr. SEA-WATERHOUSE,
R.A. By the way, the Directors of the Gordon Hotels
Co. wish it to be generally known that they have not started a
juvenile hotel for half-price children, under the name of the Gordon
Boys' Hotel.</p>

<p>Who remembers a certain story called, if I remember aright,
<i>The Wheelbarrow of Bordeaux</i>, that appeared in a Christmas
Number of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> some years ago? If no
one else does, I do, says the Baron; and that sensational story was
a sensational sell, wherein
the agony was piled up to
the "n<sup>th</sup>," and just as the
secret was about to be disclosed,
the only person who
knew it, and was on the
point of revealing it, died.
This is the sort of thing
that Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING
has just done in this month's
<i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>. It
is told in a plain, rough and
ready, blunt style, but so
blunt that there's no point in it. And the idea,&mdash;that is if the idea
be that the likeness of the assassin remains on the retina of the victim's
eye, and can be reproduced by photography,&mdash;is not a novelty.
Perhaps this story in <i>Lippincott</i> comes out of one of Mr. RUDYARD
KIPLING'S pigeon-holes, and was just chucked in haphazard, because
Editorial <i>Lippincott</i> wanted something with the name of the KIPLING,
"bright and merry," to it. It's not very "bright," and it certainly isn't "merry."</p>

<p><i>Black's Guide to Kent</i> for 1890, useful in many respects, but
not quite up to date. The Baron cannot find any information about
the splendid Golf Grounds, nor the Golf Club at Sandwich; it
speaks of Sir MOSES MONTEFIORE'S place on the East Cliff of Ramsgate
as if that benevolent centenarian were still alive; and it retains an
old-fashioned description of Ramsgate as "The favorite resort of
superior London tradesmen"&mdash;"which," says the Baron, "is, to my
certain knowledge, very far from being the case." It talks of the
"humours of the sands," and alludes to what is merely the cheap-trippers'
season, as if this could possibly be the best time for Ramsgate.
The <i>Guide</i> knows nothing, or at least says nothing, of the Winter
attractions; of the excellent pack of harriers; of the delightful climate
from mid-September to January; of the southern aspect; of the pure
air; of the many excursions to Ash, Deal, Sandwich, Ickham, and
so forth; nor can the Baron discover any mention of the Granville
Hotel, nor of the Albion Club, nor of the sport for fishers and
shooters; nor of the Riviera-like mornings in November and in the
early Spring, which are the real attractions of Ramsgate, and make
it one of the finest health-resorts in Winter for all "who love life, and
would see good days." "It reminds me," says the Baron, puffing off
his smoke indignantly, "of Mr. IRVING and a certain youthful critic,
who, in his presence at supper, had been running down <i>Macbeth</i>, finding
fault with the Lyceum production of it, and ridiculing SHAKSPEARE
for having written it. When he had quite finished HENRY IRVING,
'laying low' in his chair at the table, adjusted his pince-nez, and,
looking straight at the clever young gentleman, asked, in the mildest
possible tone, 'My dear Sir, have you ever <i>read Macbeth?</i>' So,"
resumes the Baron, "I am inclined to ask Mr. BLACK'S young man,
'Do you <i>know</i> Ramsgate?' And of course I mean the Ramsgate
of 1890."</p>

<p>From the specimens of <i>London City</i> that have been sent for inspection
by Messrs. FIELD &amp; TUER, of the Leadenhall Press, who are bringing
it out, the Baron augurs a grand result, artistically and financially.
It is to be published at forty-two shillings, but subscribers will get
it for a guinea, so intending possessors had evidently better become
subscribers. The history of the Great City is to be told by Mr. W.J.
LOFTIE, so that it starts with an elevated tone and the loftiest
principles, and the illustrations will be by Mr. WM. LUKER, a
talented draughtsman who, as a Luker-on has seen most of the
games in the City. In consequence of some piratical publisher
having attempted to bring out a work under the same title, intended
to deceive even the elect, Messrs. FIELD &amp; TUER have secured
the copyright of the title <i>London City</i>, by the ingenious device of
publishing, for one farthing each, five hundred copies of a miniature
pamphlet bearing this title, and containing the explanation. The
value of these eccentric farthing pamphlets may one day be thousands
of pounds. <i>Mem</i>.&mdash;Twopence would be well invested in purchasing
four of them.</p>

<p><i>Salads and Sandwiches</i> is an attractive title, specially at this
season. The arrangement of the book is, like the salad, a little
mixed. When, however, the knowing Baron finds that abomination
known as salad dressing, or "salad mixing," which is sold at the
grocer's, recommended by a writer who professes to teach salad-making,
then he closes the book, and reads no more that day. This
author, who is in his salad days, might bring out a book entitled <i>How
to Suck Eggs; or, Letters to my Grandmother</i>. It is a suggestion
worth considering, says</p>

<h3>IN THE KNOW.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>(By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.)</i></p>

<p>I am a modest man, as well as an honest one. Censure cannot
move me by one hair's breadth from the narrow path of rectitude;
praise cannot unduly puff me up. Had I been other than I am, this
last week would have gone fatally near to ruining that timid and
shrinking diffidence which (I say it without egotism) marks me off
from the poisonous, pestilential, hydrocephalous, putty-faced, suet-brained
reptiles who disgrace the profession to which I belong. All
I wish now to do is to point out that <i>I am the only prophet</i> who indicated,
without any beating about the bush, that <i>Marvel</i> would win
the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood. My admirers have recognised the
fact, and my private residence has been choked by an avalanche of
congratulatory despatches, including two or three from some of the
highest in the land. H.S.H., the Grand Duke of PFEIFENTOPF
says:&mdash;"You have me with your writings much refreshed. I have
the whole revenues of the Grand Duchy against one thousand
<i>flaschen</i> of lager bier gebetted, and I have won him on your noble
advice on <i>Marvel</i>. I make you Commander of the Honigthau
Order." I merely cite this to show that my appreciators are not to
one country confined&mdash;I mean, confined to one country.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/065-3.png"><img width="100%" src="images/065-3.png" alt="Mr. Punch and Prophet" /></a></div>

<p>What did I say last week, in speaking of the Stewards' Cup
horses? By the well-known grammatical
figure known as the <i>hysteroproteron,</i>
I mentioned <i>Marvel</i>
last, intending, of course, as even
a buffalo-headed Bedlamite might
have seen, that he should be first.
And he was first. But to make
assurance doubly sure, and to bring
prophecy down to the intellectual
level of a bat, I added, in speaking
of the winner, that he "would
certainly be a <i>Marvel</i>." I say no
more. As the great Cardinal once
observed to his chief of police, "<i>Je
te verrai soufflé d'abord,"</i> so I
reply to those who wish me to reveal
the secret of my success. Mr.
J. knows it not, and no single
member of the imbecile, anserous,
asinine, cow-hocked, spavin-brained, venomous, hugger-mugger
purveyors of puddling balderdash who follow him has the least conception
of my glorious system. But I am willing to teach, though I
have nothing to learn. For six halfpenny stamps those who desire
to <i>know</i>, shall receive my pamphlet on "Book-making." Every
applicant must send his photograph with his application, not
necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith.</p>

<hr />

<p>"SUR LE TAPIS."&mdash;It was a carpet that ostensibly parted an
eminent firm of composer, author, and theatrical manager. W.S.G.
didn't want D'OYLY CARPET&mdash;no, beg pardon, should have written
D'OYLY CARTE to have <i>carte blanche</i>. [Pretty name this. Is there
a BLANCHE CARTE? If not, "make it so."]&mdash;to do whatever he liked
whenever he liked with the decorating and upholstering of the theatre.
And recently another carpet, not in connection with the above firm,
created a difficulty. What's a thousand-guinea carpet to a man who
likes this sort of thing? Nothing. Yet as <i>amici curiae</i>, we would
have thought that that Tottenham Road carpet might have been kept
out of Court. Wasn't that a Blunder, MAPLE?</p>

<h4>No. XII.&mdash;CONRAD; OR, THE THUMBSUCKER.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>(Adapted freely from a well-known Poem in the "Struwwelpeter.")</i></p>

<p class="center">CHARACTERS.</p>

<p><i>Conrad (aged 6). Conrad's Mother (47). The Scissorman (age immaterial).</i></p>

<p class="scene">SCENE&mdash;<i>An Apartment in the house of</i> CONRAD'S <i>Mother, window in
centre at back, opening upon a quiet thoroughfare. It is dusk,
and the room is lighted only by the reflected gleam from the
street lamps.</i> CONRAD <i>discovered half-hidden by left window-curtain.</i></p>

<p><i>Conrad (watching street).</i> Still there! For full an hour he has not
budged beyond the circle of yon lamp-post's rays! The gaslight
falls upon his crimson hose, and makes a steely glitter at his thigh,
while from the shadow peers a hatchet-face and fixes sinister
malignant eyes&mdash;on whom? <i>(Shuddering.)</i> I dare not trust myself
to guess! And yet&mdash;ah, no&mdash;it cannot be myself! I am so young&mdash;one
is still young at six!&mdash;What man can say that I have injured
him? Since, in my Mother's absence all the day engaged upon
Municipal affairs, I peacefully beguile the weary hours by suction
of consolatory thumbs. <i>(Here he inserts his thumb in his mouth,
but almost instantly removes it with a start.)</i> Again I meet those
eyes! I'll look no more&mdash;but draw the blind and shut my terror
out. <i>(Draws blind and lights candle; Stage
lightens.)</i> Heigho, I wish my Mother were at
home! <i>(Listening.)</i> At last. I hear her latchkey
in the door!</p>

<p class="scene"><i>Enter</i> CONRAD'S Mother, <i>a lady of strong-minded
appearance, rationally attired. She
carries a large reticule full of documents.</i></p>

<p><i>Conrad's M.</i> Would, CONRAD, that you were
of riper years, so you might share your
Mother's joy to-day, the day that crowns her
long and arduous toil as one of London's
County Councillors!</p>

<p><i>Conrad.</i> Nay, speak; for though my mind
be immature, one topic still can charm my
infant ear, that ever craves the oft-repeated
tale. I love to hear of that august Assembly
<i>(his Mother lifts her bonnet solemnly)</i> in
which my Mother's honoured voice is raised!</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (gratified).</i> Learn, CONRAD, then,
that, after many months of patient "lobbying"
(you've heard the term?) the measure
by my foresight introduced has triumphed by
a bare majority!</p>

<p><i>Con.</i> My bosom thrills with dutiful delight&mdash;although
I yet for information wait as to
the scope and purpose of the statute.</p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> You show an interest so intelligent that well deserves it
should be satisfied. Be seated, CONRAD, at your Mother's knee, and
you shall hear the full particulars. You know how zealously I
advocate the sacred cause of Nursery Reform? How through my
efforts every infant's toys are carefully inspected once a month&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Con. (wearily).</i> Nay, Mother, you forget&mdash;I <i>have</i> no toys.</p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> Which brings you under the exemption clause. But&mdash;to
resume; how Nursery Songs and Tales must now be duly licensed
by our Censor, and any deviation from the text forbidden under
heavy penalties? All that you know. Well; with concern of late,
I have remarked among our infancy the rapid increase of a baneful
habit on which I scarce can bring my tongue to dwell. <i>(The Stage
darker; blind at back illuminated.)</i> Oh, CONRAD, there are children&mdash;think
of it!&mdash;so lost to every sense of decency that, in mere
wantonness or brainless sloth, they obstinately suck forbidden
thumbs! (CONRAD <i>starts with irrepressible emotion.)</i> Forgive me
if I shock your innocence! <i>(Sadly.)</i> Such things exist&mdash;but soon
shall cease to be, thanks to the measure we have passed to-day!</p>

<p><i>Con. (with growing uneasiness).</i> But how can statutes check such
practices?</p>

<p><i>C's M. (patting his head).</i> Right shrewdly questioned, boy! I
come to that. Some timid sentimentalists advised compulsory
restraint in woollen gloves, or the deterrent aid of bitter aloes. <i>I</i>
saw the evil had too deep a seat to yield to such half-hearted
remedies. No; we must cut, ere we could hope to cure! Nay,
interrupt me not; my Bill appoints a new official, by the style and
title of "London County Council Scissorman," for the detection of
young "suck-a-thumbs."</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[Here the shadow of a huge hand brandishing a gigantic pair of
shears appears upon the blind.]</i></p>

<p><i>Con. (hiding his face in his Mother's lap).</i> Ah, Mother, see!...
the scissors!... On the blind!</p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> Why, how you tremble! You've no cause to fear. The
shadow of his grim insignia should have no terror&mdash;save for thumb-suckers.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i> And what for <i>them</i>?</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (complacently).</i> A doom devised by me&mdash;the confiscation
of the culprit thumbs. Thus shall our statute cure while it corrects,
for those who have no thumbs can err no more.</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[The Shadow slowly passes on the blind</i>, CONRAD <i>appearing
relieved at its departure. Loud knocking without. Both
start to their feet.</i></p>

<p><i>C's M.</i> Who knocks so loud at such an hour as this?</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i> Open, I charge ye. In the Council's name!</p>

<p><i>C's M.</i> 'Tis the Official Red-legged Scissorman, who doubtless
calls to thank me for the post.</p>

<p><i>Con. (with a gloomy determination).</i> More like his business,
Madam, is with&mdash;Me!</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (suddenly enlightened).</i> A Suck-a-thumb?... <i>you</i>,
CONRAD?</p>

<p><i>C. (desperately).</i> Ay,&mdash;from birth!</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[Profound silence, as Mother and Son face one another. The
knocking is renewed.</i></p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> Oh, this is horrible&mdash;it must not be! I'll shoot the bolt
and barricade the door.</p>

<p class="bracket">[CONRAD <i>places himself before it, and addresses his Mother in a
tone of incisive irony.</i></p>

<p><i>Con.</i> Why, where is all the zeal you showed of late? is't thus
that you the Roman Matron play? Trick not a statute of your own
devising. Come, your official's waiting&mdash;let
him in! (C's. M. <i>shrinks back appalled.</i>) So?
you refuse!&mdash;(<i>throwing open door</i>)&mdash;then&mdash;enter,
Scissorman!</p>

<p class="scene"><i>[Enter the</i> Scissorman, <i>masked and in red tights,
with his hand upon the hilt of his shears.</i></p>

<p><i>The S. (in a passionless tone).</i> Though sorry
to create unpleasantness, I claim the thumbs
of this young gentleman, which my own eyes
have marked between his lips.</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (frantically).</i> Thou minion of a
meddling tyranny, go exercise thy loathsome
trade elsewhere!</p>

<p><i>The S. (civilly).</i> I've duties here that must
be first performed.</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (wildly).</i> Take my thumbs for his!</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> 'Tis not the law&mdash;which is a model
of lucidity.</p>

<p><i>Con. (calmly).</i> Sir, you speak well. My
thumbs are forfeited, and they alone must pay
the penalty.</p>

<p><i>The S. (with approval).</i> Right! Step with
me into the outer hall, and have the business
done without delay.</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (throwing herself between them).</i>
Stay! I'm a Councillor&mdash;this law was <i>mine!</i>
Hereby I do suspend the clause I drew.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> You should have drawn it milder.</p>

<p><i>Con.</i> Must I teach a parent laws were meant to be obeyed?
[<i>To</i> Sc.] Lead on, Sir. <i>(To his</i> Mother <i>with cold courtesy.)</i>
Madam,&mdash;may I trouble you?</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[He thrusts her gently aside and passes out with the</i> S.; <i>the
door is shut and fastened from without.</i> C's. M. <i>rushes to
door which she attempts to force without success.</i></p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> In vain I batter at a senseless door, I'll to the keyhole
train my tortured ear. <i>(Listening.)</i> Dead silence!... is it over&mdash;or,
to come? Hark! was not that the click of meeting shears?...
Again! and followed by the sullen thud of thumbs that drop upon
linoleum!...</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[The door is opened and</i> CONRAD <i>appears, pale but erect,&mdash;N.B.
The whole of this scene has been compared to one in "La
Tosca"&mdash;which, however, it exceeds in horror and intensity.</i></p>

<p><i>C's. M.</i> They send him back to me, bereft of both! My CONRAD!
What?&mdash;repulse a Mother's Arms!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/069.png"><img width="100%" src="images/069.png" alt="Mother at Son's Feet" /></a></div>

<p><i>Con. (with chilling composure).</i> Yes, Madam, for between us
ever more, a barrier invisible is raised, and should I strive to reach
those arms again, two spectral thumbs would press me coldly back&mdash;the
thumbs I sucked, in blissful ignorance, the thumbs that solaced
me in solitude, the thumbs your County Council took from me, and
your endearments scarcely will replace! Where, Madam, lay the
harm in sucking them? The dog will lick his foot, the cat her claw,
his paws sustain the hibernating bear&mdash;and you decree no law to
punish <i>them</i>! Yet, in your rage for infantine reform, you rushed
this most ridiculous enactment&mdash;its earliest victim your neglected son!</p>

<p><i>C's. M. (falling at his feet).</i> Say, CONRAD, you will some day
pardon me?</p>

<p><i>Con. (bitterly, as he regards his maimed hands.)</i> I will,&mdash;the day
these pollards send forth shoots!</p>

<p class="bracket"><i>[His</i> Mother <i>turns aside with a heartbroken wail</i>; CONRAD <i>standing
apart in gloomy estrangement as the Curtain descends.</i></p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 28.</i>&mdash;STRATHEDEN and CAMPBELL
are amongst the most regular visitors to our lobby from House
of Lords. RAVENSWORTH and UMBRELLA run
them pretty close, but come in only a good second.
Moreover, whilst RAVENSWORTH and UMBRELLA
rarely go beyond the lobby, STRATHEDEN and
CAMPBELL press forward into Gallery reserved
for Peers, and there sweetly go to sleep, "Like
Babes in the Wood," says Colonel MALCOLM,
turning over leaves of Orders as if he would like
to complete the simile by acting the part of the
birds. To-night STRATHEDEN and CAMPBELL
leave us forlorn. They have business in their
own House; been long concerned for interests
of State as affected by the MARKISS'S persistence
in combining office of Premier with that of
Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>"It would be too much even for us," said
STRATHEDEN, in conversation we had before
House met; "and," he continued, "though I
say it what shouldn't, I don't know any arrangement
that would be happier or more complete
than if we undertook the job. What do you
say, CAMPBELL? Would you be Premier, or
would you take the Foreign Seals?"</p>

<p>"The Premier place is yours," said CAMPBELL,
gallantly; "at least, it is now. When
we first started in life we used to call ourselves
CAMPBELL and STRATHEDEN. You'll find it so
in the <i>Peerages</i> of earlier date; now it's the
other way about, and STRATHEDEN takes the
<i>pas</i>."</p>

<p>"That was entirely your doing, CAMPBELL,
said STRATHEDEN; so modest, so retiring, so thoughtful! After
we'd been known as CAMPBELL and STRATHEDEN for good many
years, you came to me and said it was my turn now. I objected;
you insisted; and here we are, a power in the State, an object of
interest in the Commons, STRATHEDEN and CAMPBELL in the Lords."</p>

<p>"A little awkward, don't you think," I ventured
to say, edging in a word, "for you two
fellows to take this strong stand against
duality?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said STRATHEDEN and CAMPBELL,
both together; "we are authorities on
the subject, and we say that the MARKISS cannot
in his single person adequately perform the
dual duties pertaining to his high offices; therefore
we shall go and move our resolution protesting
against arrangement."</p>

<p>Pretty to see them marching off. Always
walk on tip-toe; ROSEBERY says it is a practice
adopted so as not to disturb each other when engaged
in thinking out deep problems; two of
the best and the happiest old fellows in the
world; their only trouble is that on divisions
their vote should count as only one. CAMPBELL,
in whom hot Cupar blood flows, once proposed
to raise question of privilege, but soothed by
STRATHEDEN, who has in him a strong strain
of the diplomatic character of his grandfather,
ABINGER.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In the Lords, STRATHEDEN
and CAMPBELL raised question of MARKISS as
Premier and Foreign Secretary. In Commons,
Anglo-German Agreement sanctioned.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Scotch Members had their innings
to-night; played a pretty stiff game till, at twelve
o'clock, stumps drawn. All about what used to
be called the Compensation Bill. Got a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
name now; Compensation Clauses dropped; but JOKIM finds it dreary
work dragging the wreck along.</p>

<p>"Seems to me, Tony," he said with a sob in his voice, "that
whatever I do is wrong. This Bill has gone through various transmogrifications
since; with a light heart, I brought it in as part of
Budget scheme. But it's all the same. Hit high or hit low, I can't
please 'em. Begin to think if there were any other business open
for me, should chuck this up."</p>

<p>"Ever been in the carpet-cleaning line?" said MAPLE-BLUNDELL,
in harsh voice, and with curiously soured face. Generally beams
through life as if it were
all sunshine. Now cloud
Seems to have fallen over
his expansive person, and
he is as gloomy as JOKIM.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/072-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/072-1.png" alt="Floored by the Carpet" /></a>Floored by the Carpet.</div>

<p>"It's all very well for
you," he continues, glowering
at JOKIM, "to complain
of your lot; but till you go
into the carpet-cleaning
line you never know what
vicissitudes mean. One
day, alighting from your
four-in-hand, and happily
able to spare to Tottenham
Court Road a few moments
from direction of national
affairs, you look in at your
shop; enter a lady who
says she wants a carpet
cleaned. 'Very well' you
say rubbing your hands,
and smiling blandly; 'and
what will be the next
article.' Nothing more.
Only this blooming carpet,
out of which, when the job
is finished and it is sent
home you make a modest
five bob. Your keen insight into figures, JOKIM, will convince
you that the coin colloquially known as five bob won't go far
to enable you to cut a figure in Society, drive four-in-hand, give
pic-nics in your park to the Primrose League, and subscribe to
the Canton Fund. However, there it is; carpet comes; you send
it out in usual way, and what happens? Why it blows itself up,
kills two boys, lames a man, and then you discover that you've been
entertaining unawares a carpet worth £1000 which you have to pay.
Did that ever happen to you at the Treasury?" MAPLE-BLUNDELL
fiercely demanded. JOKIM forced to admit that his infinite sorrows
had never taken that particular turn.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," snapped MAPLE-BLUNDELL, "don't talk to me
about your troubles. As far as I know this is the only carpet in the
world valued at £1000; it is certainly the only one that ever went off
by spontaneous combustion; and I had this particular carpet in
charge, at the very moment when it
was ready to combust spontaneously."</p>

<p>"Yes," said JOKIM, softly, as
MAPLE-BLUNDELL went off, viciously
stamping on the carpet that covers
the Library floor, "we all have our
troubles, and when I think of MAPLE-BLUNDELL
and his combustible carpet
I am able the better to bear the woes
I have."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on
Local Taxation Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"True, TOBY," OLD
MORALITY said, in reply to an observation,
"I am a little tired, and
naturally; things haven't been going
so well as they did; but I could get
along well enough if it wasn't for
SUMMERS. CONEYBEARE'S cantankerous;
STORY is strenuous; TANNER
tedious; and DILLON denunciatory.
But there's something about SUMMERS
that is peculiarly aggravating.
In the first place, he is, as far as
appearances go, such a quiet, amiable,
inoffensive young man. Looking at him, one would think that
butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, much less that Mixed Marriages
in Malta should keep him awake at night, and the question of International
Arbitration should lower his appetite. Yet you know how
it is. He seems to have some leisure on his hands; uses it to formulate
conundrums; comes down here, and propounds them to me.
Just look at his list for to-night. LINTORN SIMMONDS'S Mission to
the POPE; Customs' Duty in Algeria; International Arbitration;
Walfish Bay, and Damara Land, together with the view the Cape
Colonies may take of the Anglo-German Agreement. That pretty
well for one night; but he's gone off now, to look up a fresh batch,
which he'll unfold to-morrow. Now is the winter of our discontent,
which is chilly enough; but, for my part, I often think that life
would be endurable only for its SUMMERS."</p>

<p>Haven't often heard OLD MORALITY speak so bitterly; generally,
even at worst time, overflowing with geniality; ready to take
kindest view of circumstances, and hope for the best. But SUMMERS,
surveying mankind from China to Peru in search of material for
fresh conundrum, too much for mildest-mannered man. OLD
MORALITY, goaded to verge of madness, jumps up; hotly declines to
reply to SUMMERS; begs him to address his questions to Ministers to
whose Department they belonged.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Local Taxation Bill through Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Still in our ashes live our wonted fires. Dwelling just
now amid ashes of expiring Session; everything dull and deadly;
pounding away at Local Taxation Bill; Scotch Members to the fore,
for the fortieth time urging that the £40,000 allotted them in relief
of school fees shall be made £90,000. House divides, and also for
fortieth time says "No;" expect to go on with next Amendment;
when suddenly HARCOURT springs on OLD MORALITY'S back, digs his
knuckles into his eyes, bites his ear, and observes that he "has never
seen a piece of more unexampled insolence." OLD MORALITY, when
he recovers breath, goes and tells the Master&mdash;I mean the SPEAKER.
SPEAKER says HARCOURT shouldn't use language like that; so HARCOURT
subsides, and incident closes as rapidly and suddenly as it opened.</p>

<p>A little later COMPTON goes for RAIKES; hints that he sub-edited
for <i>Hansard</i> portions of a speech delivered in House on Post Office
affairs. RAIKES says "Noble Lord charged me with having deliberately
falsified my speech." COMPTON says he didn't. "Then,"
said RAIKES, with pleading voice that went to every heart, "I wish
the Noble Lord had the manliness to charge me with deliberate falsification."
COMPTON refused to oblige; RAIKES really depressed.</p>

<p>"Don't know what we're coming to, TOBY," he said, "when one
almost goes on his knees to ask a man to charge him with deliberate
falsification, and he won't do it. Thought better of COMPTON; see
him in his true light now." <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A good deal.</p>

<h3>A SPORTING STYLE.</h3>

<p>Our next example of a true sporting style will be constructed on
the basis of Nos. 11, 12, and 13 of the Rules. These, it will be
remembered, require the writer to refer to "the good old days;" to
be haughty and contemptuous, with a parade of rugged honesty; to
be vain and offensive, and to set himself up as an infallible judge of
every branch of sport and athletics. This particular variety of style
is always immensely effective. All the pot-boys of the Metropolis,
most of the shady bookmakers, and a considerable proportion of the
patrons of sport swear by it, and even the most thoughtful who read it
cannot fail to be impressed by its splendour. This style deals in paragraphs.
<i>Second Example.</i>&mdash;Event to be commented on: A Regatta.</p>

<p>I am led to believe by column upon column of wishy-washy
twaddle in the morning papers, that Henley Regatta has actually
taken place. The effete parasites of a decayed aristocracy who
direct this gathering endeavour year after year to make the world
believe that theirs is the only meeting at which honour has the least
chance of bursting into flower. I have my own opinions on this
point. Really, these tenth transmitters of foolish faces become more
and more brazen in their attempts to palm off their miserable two-penny-halfpenny,
tin-pot, one-horse Regatta as the combination of
all the cardinal virtues.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>These gentry presume to dictate to rowing men what shall constitute
the status of the Amateur. For my own part (and the world
will acknowledge that I have done some rowing in my time) I prefer
the straight-forward conduct of any passing rag-and-bone merchant
to the tricks of the high and mighty champions of the amateur qualification
in whose nostrils the mere name of professional oarsman seems
to stink. These pampered denizens of the amateur hothouse would,
doubtless, wear a kid-glove before they ventured to shake hands with
one who, like myself, despises them and their absurd pretensions.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As for the rowing, it was fantastic. I wasn't there. Indeed, those
who know me, would never think so meanly of me as to suppose that
I would attend this Regatta <i>pour rire</i>. But I know enough to be
sure that the Eights were slow, the Fours deficient in pace, the pairs
on the minus side of nothing, and the scullers preposterous. Rowing
must be in a bad way when it can boast no better champions (save the
mark!) than those who last week aired their incompetence, and
impeded the traffic of the people upon the Thames. Time was when
an oarsman was an oarsman, but now he is a miserable cross between
a Belgravian flunkey and a riverside tout. Which is all I care to
say on an unsavoury matter.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
